## Assessment Instructions

You have been given some data by the editorial department in the ./src/data directory.

They need you to build an interactive project where users will select an Indian city and have their local air quality displayed in cigarettes and particulate matter.

How the users select their city is up to you: editorial have used dropdowns, buttons, maps, and keyword entry autocomplete text fields before. It's your choice.

## Requirements

User will select a city - autocomplete dropdown/ buttons
System will display the cigarettes and particulate matter data
System will display all text fields in the json data

## Technical requirements

1. Serve the task as flat files
2. Can use node/ npm/ webpack, babel
3. Pay attention to file size and perfomance
4. Code should work on IE11 and up
5. Production files should output to a ./dist folder

## Approach

Use React.js + typescript
